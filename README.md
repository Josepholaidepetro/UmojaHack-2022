AirQo’s air quality sensing network has more than 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda; in most cases, these devices are deployed in unmonitored or perilous environments. These low-cost electronic devices are susceptible to breakdown caused by communication malfunction, aging, wear and tear, manufacturing deficiencies, incorrect calibration, mishandling and other external environmental factors. Faults lead to data inaccuracies and data loss, which impacts decisions and policies that could significantly impact people’s lives.

Device failure detection and monitoring is critical to AirQo’s business; faulty devices need to be identified, isolated and fixed or replaced with urgency. Data received from a device can be used to identify whether the device is working correctly or not.

This prompts a request for a data scientist to assist in the development of a model to determine whether or not a device has an offset problem. AirQo can utilize this model to automatically flag a device that is sending erroneous data.
